        <h1>Multiplayer Game Demo</h1>
        <div id="gameContainer"></div>
        <p>I wanted to see if I could make the basics of a multiplayer game system, inspired by Among Us. This is a simple demo with only a joystick which moves a square around the screen, but multiple players can be online at the same time.</p>
        <p>The code can be found <a href="https://github.com/alexclifton4/game-demo">on GitHub</a>. The server is written with Node.js, while the client uses vanilla JS and PIXI.js for graphics. The two communicate using WebSockets.</p>
        <p>Among Us was made with Unity and almost definitely uses a library for network communications, so the goal of this for me was not to replicate the game, but instead the network layer.</p>
